Selenium:jason huggins 2004
to reduce the toxicity of Mercury (QTP)

webdriver:Siemen stewards 2007

selenium webdriver v3 -2009

QTP=commercial (very costly)
-supports multiple applications
-VBscript/Javascript
-doesn't provide any support for linux/mac

selenium- no licesnse cost-open source
-supports web application only
-works with windows,Mac,linux/mac
-Java,python,Ruby,Pearl,C#,etc..,

selenium webdriver

- can automate only web applications
- It can talk to diff browsers (Opera,chrome,ff,IE,edge,safari
- works with windows,Mac,linux/mac,IOS,Android

Cannot do?
	can we automate excel sheet? NO since it's a window based application
	java lib ->Apache poi to fetch the data from excel or to write
	can we automate mainframe appl? No 
	can we automate performace testing? Jmeter/loadrunner
	can we automate database -> jdbc
	can we automate mobile based app? No java libraries-Appium
	
Opensource tools--.browsers

	selenium webdriver - more than 40percent market share
	puppeteer-chrome/js
	cypress-chrome,ff/js
	playwright-still emerging
	webdriver.io-js

How selenium works??

selenium webdriver-->rest API-->chrome driver-->chrome

to check the driver path
Run -> type .cache
UserName:Demosalesmanager
Password:crmsfa

//Driver is interacting with the browser.will check whether the driver is installed
		//or else it will download the driver
		WebDriverManager.chromedriver().setup();
		
		//If we download it manually we have to set the path. Either the above one shud be given or the below one.
		//System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "C:\\ChromeDriver\\chromedriver_win32\\chromedriver.exe");

Tagname(purple) - html,input,button
Attributes(brown) -info abt the element
Attributes values ()info abt the attribute
Text(black)--in between the tags


Locators(8): To find the web elements, locator is used
 1.id --> attribute ->1st priority
 if id contains changing numbers when we have number in the value
 2.name-->2nd priority (can be duplicate, so we need to make sure der is no  duplicate)
 3.linkText-->3rd priority -->a (anchor tag with text) 
 4.classname-->attribute-->4th priority if the class has space, we shudn't use it.
 selenium will interact the first element if we have multiple class
 5.tagName 
 leafground.com/input.xhtml
 
 sendKeys will apppend it
 getText() -wil get the text from the label(black).
 clear() - dis will not return nothing, so clear().sendKeys not possible
 isEnabled()
 getAttribute("value")- will get the values which is inside the textbox eventhough the value is available or not
 
 to select the option from dropdown
 use select class, when select tag is der for the dropdown
 select -option combo
 
 Nosuchelementexception -> xpath/locator issue
 Nostaleexception->absence of an elment in DOM or taking time to load the element in DOM
